            <p>It is drunk when hot, it's drunk when cold</p>
            <p>It is drunk by those, young and old</p>
            <p>It is perfect in the morning, it can be consumed at night</p>
            <p>It is sometimes had black, but also, on occasion, white</p>
            <p>Sugar is added, if too bitter is the flavour</p>
            <p>However it's taken, it's a taste to savour</p>
            <p>Espresso, mocha, grande or cappuccino</p>
            <p>Coffee is the best liquid tonic we know!</p>
