# Build a tribute page

Free Code Camp challenge #1.

The challenge was to meet particular criteria to pass a serious of tests. I decided to build a tribute page to coffee, as I couldn't think of anything else that deserved such gratification.

I discovered a palette that I liked from Coolors (https://coolors.co/) that contained a colour aptly named coffee. That worked for me. Using these 4 colours in the palette, I created the ultimate tribute to the caffeinated liquid gold.
